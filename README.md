# Andrew Chou's log

## Development

1. Clone git repo: `git clone https://github.com/achou11/log.git`
2. Make sure you have the following installed:
   - [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/) and [jpm](https://janet-lang.org/docs/jpm.html). Depending on how you install Janet, jpm may already be installed.
   - [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
3. Install deps: `make install-deps`
4. To build the site, run: `make bag-build`
5. View the output in a browser by opening a file in the generated `/sites` directory

## TODO

- Use jpm rules instead of a makefile?
